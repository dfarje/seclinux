<p>This is my first post.  I decided to start this blog to share my technical findinds and general thoughts on a wide range of topics. I&rsquo;m hoping the technical content found on this page can perhaps help someone out there who is looking for answers. The topics discussed in this blog include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>FOSS</li>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>IP Networking</li>
<li>Software Development</li>
<li>MIS/DevOps</li>
<li>CyberSecurity</li>

<h2 id="about-me">About me<a href="#about-me" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>My name is David Farje. I was born in 1982. My first computer was a i386 based IBM/PC clone in 1989.  The operating system was MS-DOS, the game was called &ldquo;Digger&rdquo;.  My first experience coding (1993) was QBasic and simple programs in Turbo C++. In my Windows era I briefly used Visual Basic 6.0. I discovered Linux in 1997 and began the adoption process. By 2003 I was confident in all Linux system administration aspects and running it on all my machines.  In 2005 I  started working as systems administrator then turned to network engineering and cybersecurity. The whole time I was passionate about FOSS.  It was great but I always felt like I wasn&rsquo;t really contributing to the development of the field.  It&rsquo;s a field that has given me so much and today I would like to contribute to the FOSS movement in a meaningful way.  This blog is part of that.</p>

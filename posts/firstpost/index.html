        <p>This is my first post.  I decided to start this blog as a way to publish the technical notes that I write down in markdown.  I work as a network and cybersecurity engineer with a background in coding.  I spent many years running networks and datacenters, due to this I have accumulated lots of knowledge in Linux Systems Administration and networks.  The blog will also contain my general opinion on various topics.  It is however, mostly a covering the following topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer Science</li>
<li>Computer Networks</li>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>MIS/DevOps</li>
<li>CyberSecurity</li>
</ul>
<p>It is my hope to contribute some literature in these topics and it is my ultimate hope that these articles will help others out there who want to learn about these topics.</p>

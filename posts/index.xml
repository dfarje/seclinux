      <description>Introduction I thought I would give a brief overview of my development/learning environment. Many of my wacky experiments are going to be done on a rig I built in 2022. In 2022, I was working as a cybersec consultant and decided to build a rig that would help me with what I was working on at the time. Mostly, I was going to be running many simultaneous VMs in complex topologies and running DDoS mitigation experiments on them.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I thought I would give a brief overview of my development/learning environment.  Many of my wacky experiments are going to be done on a rig I built in 2022. In 2022, I was working as a cybersec consultant and decided to build a rig that would help me with what I was working on at the time.  Mostly, I was going to be running many simultaneous VMs in complex topologies and running DDoS mitigation experiments on them.  I required a lot of memory and decent CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-hardware&#34;&gt;The Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered the parts from many different places I will not be posting the BOM here I will be posting the inxi output of the machine.  The experiments done here can be done on any machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://seclinux.net/riginxi.png&#34; alt=&#34;my rig&amp;amp;rsquo;s inxi output&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-software&#34;&gt;The software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided not to use the latest LTS but one that&amp;rsquo;s a bit older.  I do this for stability reasons and availability of documentation for bit older releases.  In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve used Debian as the distro of choice for my home servers or rigs but this time I wanted to use Ubuntu mate.  Ubuntu mate first became my favorite distro on laptop, then I eventually ended up using it on my home servers/rigs.  At work it&amp;rsquo;s a RedHat and so this blog will obviously contain RedHat content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>About this blog This is my first post. I decided to start this blog as a way to publish the technical notes that I write down in markdown, I believe in open and simple text formats as a way to generate content that has more resilience against bit rot. I will be using hugo to compile the notes into HTML.

      <content>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-this-blog&#34;&gt;About this blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first post.  I decided to start this blog as a way to publish the technical notes that I write down in markdown, I believe in open and simple text formats as a way to generate content that has more resilience against bit rot. I will be using hugo to compile the notes into HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP Networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MIS/DevOps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CyberSecurity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retro Computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m mostly writing this blog to document my own learning process.  In the past I have kept notes in various proprietary formats which made it harder for me to switch to other note taking or documentation solutions.  If I&amp;rsquo;m lucky I will have the priviledge of educating someone out there who is looking for the information I post here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is David no fancy aliases just @symtex.  I work as a network and cybersecurity engineer with a background in coding.  I spent many years deploying/operating/automating/securing networks and datacenters for many customers in Latin America some in USA and Europe.  I been toying around with Linux and networking since I was 14 years old.  I&amp;rsquo;m 40 at the time of this writing so you know I have a few stories to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

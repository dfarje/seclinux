## About me
My name is David Farje. I've been tinkering with computers and Linux since I was a young boy. My first experience with computing was on a IBM/PC clone in 1988.  The operating system was MS-DOS.  My first experience coding was QBasic and Turbo C++.  Later I used Visual Basic 6.0.  then I discovered FOSS/UNIX/Linux ecosystem and Emacs/vim.  I fell in love and never turned back.  Today I consider myself a Linux/FOSS specialist among other things.

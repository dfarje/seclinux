This is my first post.  I decided to start this blog as a way to publish the technical notes that I write down in markdown.  I work as a network and cybersecurity engineer with a background in coding.  I spent many years running networks and datacenters, due to this I have accumulated lots of knowledge in Linux Systems Administration and networks.  The blog will also contain my general opinion on various topics.  It is however, mostly a covering the following topics.

- Computer Science
- Computer Networks
- Programming
- MIS/DevOps
- CyberSecurity

It is my hope to contribute some literature in these topics and it is my ultimate hope that these articles will help others out there who want to learn about these topics.

## About me
My name is David Farje. I was born in 1982. My first computer was a i386 based IBM/PC clone in 1989.  The operating system was MS-DOS, the game was called "Digger".  My first experience coding (1993) was QBasic and simple programs in Turbo C++. In my Windows era I briefly used Visual Basic 6.0. I discovered Linux in 1997 and began the adoption process. By 2003 I was confident in all Linux system administration aspects and running it on all my machines.  In 2005 I  started working as systems administrator then turned to network engineering and cybersecurity. The whole time I was passionate about FOSS.  It was great but I always felt like I wasn't really contributing to the development of the field.  It's a field that has given me so much and today I would like to contribute to the FOSS movement in a meaningful way.  This blog is part of that.

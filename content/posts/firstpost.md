## About this blog
This is my first post.  I decided to start this blog as a way to publish the technical notes that I write down in markdown, I believe in open and simple text formats as a way to generate content that has more resilience against bit rot. I will be using hugo to compile the notes into HTML. 

- FOSS 
- Computer Science
- IP Networking
- Software Development
- MIS/DevOps
- CyberSecurity
- Retro Computing
- Misc

I'm mostly writing this blog to document my own learning process.  In the past I have kept notes in various proprietary formats which made it harder for me to switch to other note taking or documentation solutions.  If I'm lucky I will have the priviledge of educating someone out there who is looking for the information I post here.

## About me
My name is David no fancy aliases just @symtex.  I work as a network and cybersecurity engineer with a background in coding.  I spent many years deploying/operating/automating/securing networks and datacenters for many customers in Latin America some in USA and Europe.  I've been tinkering with Linux and networking since I was 14 years old.  I'm 40 at the time of this writing so you know I have a few stories to tell.

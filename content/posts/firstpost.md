This is my first post.  I decided to start this blog as a way to publish the technical notes that I write down in markdown, I believe in open and simple text formats as a way to generate content that has more resilience against bitrot. I will be using hugo to compile the notes into HTML. 

I work as a network and cybersecurity engineer with a background in coding.  I spent many years running/automating networks and datacenters, due to this I have accumulated lots of knowledge in Linux Systems Administration and networks (all kinds of network gear).  The blog will also contain observations on various industry topics.  I will mostly be covering the following:

- FOSS 
- Computer Science
- IP Networking
- Software Development
- MIS/DevOps
- CyberSecurity
- Retro Computing
- Misc

I'm mostly writing this blog to document my own learning process.  In the past I have kept notes in various proprietary formats.

## Introduction

I thought I would give a brief overview of my development/learning environment.  Many of my wacky experiments are going to be done on a rig I built in 2022. In 2022, I was working as a cybersec consultant and decided to build a rig that would help me with what I was working on at the time.  Mostly, I was going to be running many simultaneous VMs in complex topologies and running DDoS mitigation experiments on them.  I required a lot of memory and decent CPU.


## The Hardware

I ordered the parts from many different places I will not be posting the BOM here I will be posting the inxi output of the machine.  The experiments done here can be done on any machine.

## The software

I decided not to use the latest LTS but one that's a bit older.  I do this for stability reasons and availability of documentation for bit older releases.  In the past I've used Debian as the distro of choice for my home servers or rigs but this time I wanted to use Ubuntu mate.  Ubuntu mate first became my favorite distro on laptop, then I eventually ended up using it on my home servers/rigs.  At work it's a RedHat and so this blog will obviously contain RedHat content.
